2. Python 3.8.10 was used

3. Windows Version 10.0.19044 Build 19044

4. All code in contained inside of the find_route.py file. The code is implemented in a functional style with no
classes used. There is no one entry function to the program either, it must be called as a file

5. Run the code using "python find_route.py {input_file} {start city} {destination city}"
If on a system with both python 2 and 3 the python might have to be replaced with python3.
The code does not perform any checks on these values and assumes all are valid.
